# What is asr?

asr is not Automatic Speech Recognition,it's just a game server written in rust.
So it's just a lazy short cut.
asr is written mostly of safe code(of course we should write safe rust code).

# Why rust?

Many advantages for rust to write a game server,but I do not want to figure them all.Except for the below:

1.Memory management thank for rust.

2.High performance concurrency and 'safe' language features.

3.Good branch stuctures and error(or Try trait) statement.

Then the last one,no gc without extro memory management as c/c++, and 'hardly' crash unless we do like self destruction.

# Thanks!

Thanks for tokio and tirinity core team.

This server is written based on tokio/mini-redis and trinity core.

# Steps:

This server framework is under processing for the first version,this may take me few days or weeks(off hours after my child slept :)).

# Help?

Any questions please send to my email jks8978@yeah.net.

Or any discussion or suggest on this framework or for rust,welcome too.

# Other:

Readme will be updated once the code is commited, more details will be here.
