# asr
# What is asr?

   asr is not Automatic Speech Recognition,it's just a game server written in rust.
   So it's just a lazy short cut.
   asr is written mostly of safe code(of course we should write safe rust code).

# Why rust?

  Many advantages for rust to write a game server,but I do not want to figure them all.Except for the below:

    1.Memory management thank for rust.

    2.High performance concurrency and 'safe' language features.

    3.Good branch stuctures and error(or Try trait) statement.

  Then the last one,no gc without extro memory management as c/c++, and 'hardly' crash unless we do like self destruction.

# Thanks!

    Thanks for tokio and tirinity core team.

    This server is written based on tokio/mini-redis and trinity core.
